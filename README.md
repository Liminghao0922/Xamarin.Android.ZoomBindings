# Xamarin.Android.ZoomBindings
A Xamarin Android binding library for the [Zoom SDK](https://github.com/zoom/zoom-sdk-android).

This project is at its very early stages.
The sample project won't compile.
Issues are to be resolved first.

The Visual Studio Solution is composed of 4 projects:
  - 2 binding projects (ZoomBindings & ZoomUtils)
  - An utility program GenerateZoomBindingsMetadata
  - A demo project ( ZoomDemo)
